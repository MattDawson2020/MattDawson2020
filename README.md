## üì£ About Me

- Who I am [My GitHub CV](https://github.com/MattDawson2020/CV)
- I used to be a photographer at a PropTech startup
- I‚Äôm recently completed the Full Stack Software Engineer course at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/)
- I most recently finished: [Fridge Savant (React front end)](https://github.com/MattDawson2020/fridge-savant-client) [Fridge Savant (Node/ Express back end)](https://github.com/mikejeuga/fridge-savant-server) and subsequent MERN revision/learning
- I'm currently working on: Leaning Python to build better back ends to work with React 

## üéØ  My Next Goal?
- My next goal is to learn Python in order to explore AI and intelligence in algorithmic problem solving
- I intend to work with Maker's colleagues on new projects to explore capabilities/ new technologies
- To rewrite some of my top projects in new technology stacks or to superior quality/ features 


## ‚ö°  What Inspired me?
**These are the companies that inspired me to become a developer, each found while looking for investment opportunities** <br>
**I am a shareholder of each of these companies and believe they are the future FAANG company equivalents**

      In our final project, my team decided to build a simple API based app that could search for recipes from your chosen ingredients. 
      This was intentionally kept simple to allow us to focus on the main challenge, using the MERN stack with no previous experience in less than two weeks.
      We were successful in this and using REACT allowed us to create a dynamic and flowing front end with tight UX and styling.
      Using MONGO, EXPRESS, and NODE for the back end meant our bookmarks were saved in JSON format, the same as the API returns, allowing reuse of components.

       The Server side project was built my members of my team, intended to store user & bookmark data as JSON packages.
       This also allowed us to move on from using sessions to the far more popular JAVASCRIPT WEB TOKENS for authentication.
       The learning objectives for this week were:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li> To use high-quality processes to build an extended project in a team</li>
       <li> Creating a fully functioning back end server in entirely new languages/ frameworks</li>

    <td style="vertical-align: top">
     <p>
      The client REACT application was built by myelf and other members of my team. 
      I mainly worked on the API data requests and the Meal card components, as well as the advertising preview column.
      The necessary skills covered in this challenge were:
     </p>
      <ul>
       <li> Building reusable and DRY components</li>
       <li> Using states, contexts and other REACT functionality to optimise the logic</li>
       <li> Learn to use an entirely new framework while maintaing best practices</li>
