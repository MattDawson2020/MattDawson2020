## 🇨🇮 About Me

- Who I am [My GitHub CV] (https://github.com/MattDawson2020/CV)
- I used to be a photographer at a PropTech startup
- I’m currently a student at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/about-us/)
- I most recently finished: [Fridge Savant (React front end)](https://github.com/jasonrowsell/fridge-savant-client) [Fridge Savant (Node/ Express back end)](https://github.com/mikejeuga/fridge-savant-server)
- I'm currently working on: Revising MERN stack development, as it provides a more industry representitive experience compared to Rails

## 🎯  My Next Goal?
- My next goal is to learn Python in order to explore AI and intelligence in algorithmic problem solving
- I intend to work with Maker's colleagues on new projects to explore capabilities/ new technologies
- To rewrite some of my top projects in new technology stacks or to superior quality/ features 


##  ⚡ What Inspired me?

       Throughout this week we worked to user stories and specifications rather than direct challenge instructions for the first time.

       Details of coaches feedback and proposed changes are inside the repos.<br>
       *As of this moment Ruby bank test is complete, Ruby Gilded Rose requires another refactor based on coaches feedback. <br>
       I have a nearly completed JS version of bank test I will soon be submitting, and will do the same for Gilded Rose.*<br>

     In our final project, my team decided to build a simple API based app that could search for recipes from your chosen ingredients. 
     This was intentionally kept simple to allow us to focus on the main challenge, using the MERN stack with no previous experience in less than two weeks.
     We were successful in this and using REACT allowed us to create a dynamic and flowing front end with tight UX and styling.
     Using MONGO, EXPRESS, and NODE for the back end meant our bookmarks were saved in JSON format, the same as the API returns, allowing reuse of components.

       The Server side project was built my members of my team, intended to store user & bookmark data as JSON packages.
       This also allowed us to move on from using sessions to the far more popular JAVASCRIPT WEB TOKENS for authentication.
       The learning objectives for this week were:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li> To use high-quality processes to build an extended project in a team</li>
